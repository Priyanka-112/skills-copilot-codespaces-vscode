🚀 Starting My Python Journey! 🚀

Excited to share that I’ve started learning Basic Python Programming! 🎯 As someone exploring coding for the first time, I’m diving into fundamental concepts like input/output and gradually building my understanding.

Why Python? 🐍
✔️ Beginner-friendly
✔️ Widely used in biotechnology (my field of interest)
✔️ Essential for lab practicals and research

This is just the beginning! I plan to document my progress step by step and eventually share my projects on GitHub. 💡

Would love to connect with fellow learners and experts! Any tips for a beginner? Drop them in the comments! 💬👇
